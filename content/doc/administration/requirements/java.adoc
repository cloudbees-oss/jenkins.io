There are separate run and job execution requirements for Jenkins installations.

## Running Jenkins

Modern Jenkins versions have the following Java requirements:

* Java 8 is the **ONLY** currently supported runtime environment, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are supported
* Older versions of Java are not supported
* Java 9 and Java 10 are not supported
* Java 11 preview support is available in Jenkins 2.155+
** link:/blog/2018/12/14/java11-preview-availability/[This page] provides guidelines about running Jenkins with these versions
* Java 12 is not supported

These requirements apply to all components of the Jenkins system including Jenkins master,
all types of agents, CLI clients, and other components.

Jenkins project performs a full test flow with the following JDK/JREs:

* OpenJDK JDK / JRE 8 - 64 bits

JRE/JDKs from other vendors are supported and may be used.
See link:/redirect/issue-tracker[our Issue tracker] for known Java compatibility issues.

## Executing jobs on Jenkins

Jenkins jobs may be executed on Java versions different from the master/agent runtime.
Generally, Jenkins allows ANY version of JRE/JDK to be invoked during the build.
It includes:

* Execution of Java commands from CLI
* Installation and execution of build steps using JDK managed by JDK tool installers

In the case of particular plugins, there are still Java requirements:

* If you use plugin:maven-plugin[Maven Integration Plugin], version of JDK used for the build must be equal
to the version used by Jenkins
* If you use plugin:swarm[Swarm Plugin] to create agents,
JRE version must be equal to the version of the master
* If you use plugin:docker-workflow[Docker Pipeline Plugin] with a bundled JRE/JDK to execute jobs,
versions of such bundled Java must be equal to the version of the master

## Monitoring Java versions

Modern versions of Jenkins master and agents verify Java requirements
and notify users when they are launched with unsupported version.

In order to do fine-grain monitoring of Java versions on agents,
you can use plugin:versioncolumn[Jenkins Versions Node Monitors plugin] to setup Java version monitoring across the Jenkins system.
