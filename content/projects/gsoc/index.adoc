link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== GSoC 2019

We have applied to Google Summer of Code 2019,
accepted organizations will be announced on February 26.

project proposal questions and discussions, process and timeline related questions. For private matters such as communication
difficulties with mentors, students, or org admins, please use the admin mailing list shown link:#orgadmin[below].

=== Office hours

Although we use mailing lists as the main communication channel,
we also have regular "office hours" video calls.
During these timeslots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors are available for any GSoC-related questions.

Before the announcement of accepted projects,
we will be using a weekly link:sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] meeting as the office hours slot (2PM UTC on Wednesdays).
More slots may be added in the future.
We post links in link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[our Gitter channel]

Meetings are recorded on-demand and posted link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG[here].

In addition to these organization-wide meetings,
each GSoC project has regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
See the project pages for the schedule.
