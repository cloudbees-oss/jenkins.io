There are currently many reincarnations of plugin management across Jenkins, including:

  * link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#preinstalling-plugins[Docker images install-plugins.sh script]
  * link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager[Custom WAR Packager]
  * link:https://jenkins.io/projects/evergreen/[Jenkins Evergreen]
  * link:https://github.com/ndeloof/jenkinsfile-runner-go[A Jenkinsfile Runner implementation]
  * link:https://github.com/coreos/jenkins-os/blob/master/init.groovy[coreOS groovy script]

This project will create a new Plugin Manager CLI tools and a library which would unify the plugin management across different Jenkins implementations.
Although we looked at extracting plugin management from Jenkins Core into its own module, this proved to be a challenging first step (see link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-57672[JENKINS-57672]).
Phase 1 focused on extracting the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/install-plugins.sh[docker install-plugins bash script] to Java.
Phase 2 will focus on improving upon what was written in Phase 1 and full integration with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker[Jenkins Docker] and the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[Configuration as Code Plugin].
More robust input parsing and support to view security warnings and available updates for plugins will be included in these improvements.

=== Phase 1 Update
An alpha version of the library and CLI tool has been released! It implements basic functionality of the install-plugins.sh script to take in plugins and download them to a user-specified directory.
